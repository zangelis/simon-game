# Simon Game

In this project I built the game Simon to get more familiar with jQuery.

## How to play
You can press any key to start and the game will show you a tile to click on. And as you go from level to level, the patterns get more and more complicated. Eventually you make a mistake and the game is over. In this case, you can press any key to restart it.

## Installation & Usage
To check out my code, just clone the repository like this:
```
git clone https://github.com/zangelis/simon-game.git
cd simon-game
```
If you want to view the page in the browser, copy the path from index.html and paste it into the search bar.
